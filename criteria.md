# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
The city guides are structured by town and topic, so four of five questions
should retrieve a chunk from the relevant guide even before I improve the
chunking strategy.

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
The answer generator is given the retrieved source names and the corpus is
small and internally consistent, so every answer should be able to cite at
least one guide without guessing.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
The starter measurements show in-scope best distances from 0.305 to 0.485 and
out-of-scope distances from 0.829 to 0.903, so a 0.6 cutoff leaves a useful
gap between the two groups.

---

## 4. Something about your chunks

At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks should end at a sentence boundary and keep the
heading with the section it introduces.



**Why this target:**
The city guides are organized under headings, but the starter's fixed-size
chunks cut through words and sentences, including the accessibility chunk that
ends in the middle of a sentence. A structural chunker should make most sample
chunks readable on their own.



---

## 5. Your choice

At least 4 of 5 in-scope answers should cite the guide that contains the
supporting fact, not merely cite an unrelated retrieved document.



**Why this target:**
The usefulness of a travel guide depends on sending a visitor to the right
town or regional guide, so correct source attribution matters in addition to
getting a plausible answer.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
