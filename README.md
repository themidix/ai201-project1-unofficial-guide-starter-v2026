# Unit 1

## What This Does

I chose the city_guides corpus, which contains fourteen structured travel
guides about towns and the surrounding region. The system answers practical
questions about transportation, accessibility, food, seasons, walking, and
what to see. The documents are organized by headings such as Getting there,
Getting around, and When to go, so the retrieval results can be connected to a
specific town or regional topic.

## Chunking Strategy

**Strategy:** heading-aware (`chunker.py::split_documents`)
**Split threshold:** 800 characters

The city guides are organized under markdown headings (`# Town`, `##  Getting
there`, `## When to go`, ...), and the fact that answers a given question
lives entirely inside the section its heading introduces. The starter's fixed
800-character windows ignored that and cut headings away from their
paragraphs, and even split sentences in half (the accessibility guide's
"Practical" section, for one).

My chunker splits every document on its heading lines first, so a chunk never
crosses a heading boundary — each section becomes one chunk with its heading
kept at the top. A section longer than 800 characters would be split further,
on paragraph breaks or (if a single paragraph is still too long) sentence
boundaries, with the heading repeated on each piece. In practice no section in
this corpus is that long: re-indexing produced 94 chunks averaging 305
characters, longest 711 — every one of them a whole section, none split
further.

Result: 94 chunks from 14 documents (up from 51 with the fixed-size baseline),
because most sections are shorter than 800 characters and used to get bundled
together across heading boundaries.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** - source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` - produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
# Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** - source: `guide_corry_vale.md#5` - produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## Where to stay

Perhaps thirty beds in the entire valley, spread across two pubs and a
handful of farmhouse rooms. In summer these are booked months ahead. Camping
is permitted on two marked fields and nowhere else.
```

**Chunk 3** - source: `guide_givens_mill.md#2` - produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## Getting around

Everything is on one street along the river. The mill is at one end and the
church at the other, eight minutes apart. The riverside path continues in
both directions for as far as you want to walk.
```

**Chunk 4** - source: `guide_kestrelford.md#4` - produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## What to see

The market square on a Saturday morning is the main event and has run
continuously since the 1400s. The parish church has a 13th-century tower you
can climb for £2. The old trackbed walk runs six miles to the next village
along an easy gradient and is the best half-day here.
```

**Chunk 5** - source: `guide_pellew_sands.md#6` - produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## When to go

June and September for the beach without the crowds. July and August are busy
and the town is at its most itself, for better and worse. Winter is bleak,
largely closed, and has a following among people who like that sort of thing.
```

Every sampled chunk above ends at a sentence boundary and keeps its heading —
none of them is a fixed-size cut through the middle of a paragraph anymore.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** How often do Marchwood trams run on weekdays?

```
Marchwood trams run every 8 minutes on weekdays, according to
guide_marchwood.md.

Sources retrieved: guide_eating.md, guide_kestrelford.md,
guide_marchwood.md, guide_regional_transport.md
```

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.6

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

Re-measured after the Milestone 3 chunker change, since new chunk boundaries
mean new embeddings and new distances:

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---:|
| How often do Marchwood trams run on weekdays? | Yes | 0.384 |
| When are the gardens at Thornby Wells best? | Yes | 0.415 |
| Which town is easiest for visitors with limited mobility? | Yes | 0.487 |
| How many weekday buses run from Brightwater to Givens Mill? | Yes | 0.364 |
| How long does the railway take from Brightwater to the regional hub? | Yes | 0.264 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.803 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.892 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.975 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.846 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.813 |

The gap widened slightly (0.487 to 0.803, versus 0.485 to 0.829 before), so
0.6 is still comfortably in the middle and I left it unchanged.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.** I used AI to help interpret the starter's output and identify that the
city guides were structurally different from the short-post corpora. I kept
the observation that the documents are heading-based, but chose the corpus and
the questions myself.

**2.** I used AI to diagnose the macOS CoreML failure from the ONNX runtime and
confirm that Chroma supports an explicit CPU provider. I changed `store.py` to
use `CPUExecutionProvider`, then verified that all 51 chunks indexed and that
an end-to-end question succeeded.

**3.** I asked AI to write the Milestone 3 heading-aware chunker for
`chunker.py`, since the city guides are structured under markdown headings and
I wanted every chunk to stop at a heading and a sentence boundary rather than
a raw character count. It split on headings and re-split oversized sections on
paragraph, then sentence, boundaries. I re-indexed, re-checked all ten
distances in the cutoff table by hand, and confirmed all five in-scope
questions still surfaced their answer chunk in the top 5 before accepting it.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
